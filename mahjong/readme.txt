Mahjongg Wii v0.8 23 Feburary 2009

v0.8 changes

Added multiple tilesets!
Added character voices on 2 player versus mode 
Re-encoded and removed cracklys from the sound effects
Added graphic when two player game ends as a draw
Tidied up and fixed bugs around the placing of tiles / shuffling
Fixed bug where saved music volume was not being used on startup
Changed screenshot function to output filenames with date and time instead of just one
Cleaned up the code that deals with memory allocation of textures in the menus
Added new menu music + other music tracks for the different tilesets/themes during the game
Fixed some memory allocation problems that may have caused memory to be held onto when mahjongg is exited and could have caused problems moving between the menu and the game if done numerous times
Added pressing A button on already selected tile deselects it 
Added proper support for widescreen including options to turn it on or off
Changed config loading and saving to include widescreen and tileset selections. Does in a way that is backwards compatible with version 0.7 config files
Added Norwegian language support
Changed internationalisation code to fully support utf8 encoding thus giving the use of non-ASCII characters without the need for mapping
Change to auto detect whether the game has been loaded from a loader or not and exit accordingly (either reset to menu or back to loader)
Fixed even more bugs

v0.7 changes

Changed to automatically select the language based on the Wii menu language settings (Nintendo only support Japanese, English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch) but as Mahjongg Wii supports more languages, I have kept the language selection screen, but moved it to be accessible via the game options screen
Added three new tile layouts - fortress, crab and spider
Changed placement algorithm to handle complexity of new tile layouts
Added a layout selection screen which can be accessed by selecting change layout from options menu
Changed all the backgrounds from png to jpeg and at same time doubled their resolution so they now look much cleaner
Added hint functionality to the game (not hover hint) so that if it the icon is pressed a hint selection is highlighted in flashing yellow and 30 seconds are added to the time as a penalty
Added Wiimote rumble when a tile pair is successfully selected
Added an option to turn the rumble feature on or off
Added the saving and loading of configuration data to SD card (mahjongg.cfg on root of SD)
Added SDHC support
Added Danish language support
Wrote language selection paging - now with 9 languages per page with the plus and minus buttons (or on screen equivalents) used to move between them
Added button B usage as an alternative back button whilst in the menus
Added callback functions so that power and reset on the Wii now work and power button on the wiimote now turns the Wii off
Fixed several bugs

v0.6 changes

Added versus mode!
Re-factored the tile selection processing and completed all coding around tile selection for both versus and coop modes
Added option to restart the game when paused or no more moves left
Added option to start a new game without going back to the menu when current game has finished
Changed so that if only two tiles are left which are on top of each other the game finishes
Fixed bug where tile placement algorithm gets stuck in an infinite loop when it cannot place all tiles successfully. Now if this occurs it finishes the shuffle and returns to no more moves mode
Alternated which pointer is drawn first every frame to not give the advantage to player one in two player versus mode
Added separate tile selections per player (this affects the co-op mode as well as the versus mode) 
Added Hungarian, Finish and Swedish languages

v0.5dol changes

Replaced boot.elf with boot.dol for compatibility with homebrew channel beta 9

v0.5 changes

Added multi-language support currently supporting English, French, Italian, Dutch, German, Spanish, Catalan Japanese and Portuguese
Wrote an algorithm to initialise the tiles so that tiles pairs are added in a selectable order 
Added a language selection menu including waving flags when hovering above them
Allowed entering and exiting pause in game by pressing the plus button on the wiimote 
Changed menu selections so that they are only the size of the text for the chosen language

v0.4 changes

Added multiple tile layouts (four to start with) (re-wrote tile engine to handle this)
Added shuffle option when no more tiles pairs left
Added an icon and count of the number of available matching tiles during the game
Made the non-selectable tiles slightly darker that the selectable ones so easier to see
Added a gong sound to the start of the game
Added new true type font for all non static text (tile layout names, time in game, etc)

v0.3 changes

Added two player co-op mode 
Added full set of menus as per new graphics courtesy of DayDreamOz
Added pause to game mode entered and exited by pressing a pause icon 
I've been re-writing the way the game board works to support multiple tile layouts, as part of this I have also been developing a tile layout editor which I will also release once in a reasonable state. All this should mean that adding some of the new functionality that I want to put in will be a lot easier than before.

Cleaned up resources better
Fixed major bugs that was causing game to dump when moving between the game and the menus
Fixed graphical glitch on startup

v0.2 changes

Added selected pair fading routine
Added better font and aligned the text better 
Added music
Fixed accidental selection of piece below ones just removed 
Was having problems with using modplay and mp3player at the same time so changed to use sndlib and now have both music and sound fx completed 

Controls

Menu

Move around with the wiimote
A - Select menu item
B - Back to previous menu

Game

Move around with the wiimote

A - Select a tile / pause, etc.
B - de-select selected tile
Plus - pause / un-pause
Home - quit game for menu

Player 1 always takes control of the selection of menu items, pause, etc.


Play Modes

One player

A single player tries to remove all the tile pairs in the shortest possible time.


Two Player Co-op

Two players play cooperatively trying to remove all tiles in the shortest possible time. Both players can select tiles independently with each player also having the capability to finish off the others pairing by selection a equivalent tile.


Two Player Versus

Two players compete against each other to get the highest score. Points are awarded for each matching tile pair selected, with different tile types being worth different amounts as follows:-

Tile Type			Pair Value
Bamboo, Characters & Circles 	5
Winds				10
Seasons & Flowers 		15
Dragons 			20

If one player gets multiple pairs in a row without the other player getting any pairs, points are multiplied by the number of pairs in a row (e.g. x2 x3 x4 etc.)

Stealing - players can select tiles already selected by the other player thus disrupting / deselecting the other players choice.
